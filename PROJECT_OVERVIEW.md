# Attention U-Net for Leather Defect Segmentation

## Problem Statement
Leather surfaces contain complex textures and irregular defects that are difficult to detect using classical vision methods or manual inspection.

## Proposed Solution
A semantic segmentation–based approach using Attention U-Net to precisely localize defect regions regardless of defect type.

## Industrial Motivation
Accurate defect localization enables automated quality control, reduces human error, and supports scalable industrial inspection pipelines.

## Key Characteristics
- Pixel-level defect localization
- Attention-guided feature selection
- Robust to texture ambiguity
- Applicable to other surface inspection domains
